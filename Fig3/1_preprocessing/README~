#trueTrees
1. Extract true trees from dream challenge tsv file (generate_true_trees.R), scale the branch lengths in hours and save them as newick files
2. Each internal node from intMEMOIR dataset represents a 15min (0.25 h) interval. Add 7.5 min to incoming branch and 7.5 min to outgoing branches, effectively placing the true node height in the center of this time interval. (addNodeTimeToTrueTrees.R).  
3. Manually check that trees are ultrametric. If not, this is a result of a cell dying (and hence a missing node time interval in the ground truth dataset). We add the minimal number of branch length extensions, s.t. the trees are ultrametric. (These trees are then in ../dat/trueTrees/trueTreesCenteredNodeHeights/manualCorrection/)

2. Extract tip states (ie. alignment) from true trees (correctTipStatesFromTrueTrees.R)
3.
