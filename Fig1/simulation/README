The code in this directory draws 1000 simulation parameters from the respective prior distributions. For each parameter set, a phylogeny and an alignment is simulated using TiDeTree.

The files perform the following functions:
- run.sh runs the entire simulation
- draw_simulation_params.R generates 1000 simulation parameter sets and stores them in ./simParams/
- realistic_simulation_1type.xml is the xml file that is used by TiDeTree to run the simulations. The resulting files are stored in ./simulationOutput/
